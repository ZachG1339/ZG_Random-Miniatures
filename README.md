# ZG_Random-Miniatures
This is a project dump for miniatures I am making or have made using CAD. They are all replicas of video game and real world things meant for 3D printing. I do not own the rights to the inspirations or originals which these models were based off of. All CADs were made myself using Fusion360.

The following screenshots are of the models in chronological order from my first attempts using Fusion360 until the end of high school:
