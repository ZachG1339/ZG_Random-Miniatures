# ZG_Random-Miniatures
This is a project dump for miniatures I'm making or have made using CAD. They are all replicas of video game and real world things meant for 3D printing. While I did not have a hand in any of the original "things", these CADed recreations were my own work as a hobbyist.

Many are from when I started on Fusion 360 and there is some hint of progression between them.
